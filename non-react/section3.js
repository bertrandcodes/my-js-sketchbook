How do we handle comparing or operating on both an object and a primitive at the same time?

How are objects converted to the correct primitive?

First thing JavaScript does is call the method [Symbol.toPrimitive] to see if it exists

/*

If not, we look at the context for a "hint", to see whether coersion to a string or to a number is more appropriate.

For example, if we are using alert(obj) we probably want to output a string, but if we are using arithmetics we probably want a number.

Then either the valueOf() or toString() properties is called. These are older JavaScript object methods, which is why they dont have Symbol in their names.

Sometimes we opt to write our own toString() methods as a catch all for both number and string conversions.

/*
In JavaScript, primitives need to be lightweight, but it's also helpful to have methods on them like objects.

The solution is to create a temporary "object wrapper" is created when we do something like str.toUpperCase(). str here is still a primitive, but to use a method an object is created and destroyed for us by the JavaScript engine efficiently.
